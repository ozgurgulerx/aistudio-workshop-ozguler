# Deploying & Monitoring your Chat App 

Once we have a working chat app we can start deploying it.
On the top right, find the "deploy" button.
![Alt text](../../media/6.1deploy.png) 

Choose a compute instance and cluster node count...
Make sure "inferenceing data collection" and "application insights diagnostics" are enabled. It may take 1-2 minutes for the endpoint to be deployed.

The app will be deployed as a standard AzureML endpoint.
You can use the "Endpoints" in the left vertical menu to monitor deployment progress... 
![Alt text](../../media/6.1deploy03.png) 

Once the endpoint is up and running we can use it for queries or wrap it within a UI  (a frontend such as a React app running on Azure AppService).

Clock on the endpoint to get the details...

Copy the REST endpoint URL from below...
Make sure the "Egress public network access" is "Enabled" on the deployment details section on the right of the screen.

Click on "Consume" and copy the endpoint auth key.

_The current version of PromptFlow Index Lookup tool requires access to Azure ML workspace data asset, so currently the endpoint identity needs to be granted with such permission. Therefore currently we need to explicitly grant the endpoint identity "AzureML Data Scientist" role to the workspace or other roles which has "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/data/versions/read" permission._

Next, as per above grant the "AzureML Data Scientist" role to the endpoint.
To do that go to azure ml and workspace management as explained here [link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:bc02be29581e4878b1466dc48d0693c1@thread.skype/1704445451292?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=88aa174e-6310-4634-bfcb-5761e1a1190a&parentMessageId=1704441594903&teamName=ML%20Platform&channelName=Prompt%20Flow&createdTime=1704445451292).

You will need to add the ML Data Scientist role to both the workspace and the endpoint. 
(Choose members and find the correct items.)


Then send a query to the endpoint with a curl statement as below...
```
curl -X POST "https://z401-workspace-promptflow--ytyag.eastus2.inference.ml.azure.com/score" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer iZz2zoJIytFrqlY2667E0YZQ5ztBH9bn" \
     -d '{"query":"how does the world economy look like?",
          "question": "how does the world economy look like?",
          "chat_history": "[]"
     }'
```

We confirmed the endpoint works. The endpoint can easily be wrapped within a UI/frontend which can be deployed as an app running on Azure AppService that may provide insights as to the current state of the economy.
