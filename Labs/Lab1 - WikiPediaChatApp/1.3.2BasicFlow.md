# 1.3.2 Create a Basic Flow with LLM tool
In this section we will build a chatflow to demonstrate capabilities of PromptFlow on AI Studio...

Create a "Chat Flow' by cloning the standard Chat template. \
(Follow Section 1.2 for a step-by-step guidance.) 

Make sure there is a VM running under Project Settings. \
(If there isn't create a new VM.)
Then Choose the created VM with the default runtime under advanced settings, update LLM block details and try and confirm the flow is running.

Click on the LLM chat block and inspect the code!

## What is JINJA?
Jinja is a templating engine that offers several benefits when used in Azure AI Studio to define prompts. It enables the dynamic generation of content that adapts to user interactions and preserves conversation context, which enhances the relevance and accuracy of responses. The reusability and modularity of templates aid in scaling and maintaining consistency across applications, while the clear separation of logic and presentation streamlines development. Moreover, Jinja's flexibility facilitates easy customization of prompts without modifying the underlying application logic, making it an effective tool for developing responsive, context-aware, and customizable AI-driven applications.

To understand Jinja constructs in more detail, please refer to the [Jinja official documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)

## DAG STRUCTURE & INPUT / OUTPUT RELATIONSHIPS 

PromptFlow uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure.
Flow is "directed" meaning it flows in a certain direction. 
Each module (tool in PF terminology) takes its input from prior modules and its output can be taken as input by any other tool.

The flow is "acyclic" meaning it is not "cyclic", a closed curve. Ultimately it is a pipeline of finite set of steps taking an input and outputing a result.

Input and Output modules are static. 
Input designates the "user prompt" received in chat. \
Output is what the flow generates.


## MODIFYING THE JINJA CODE
The LLM tool in the sample flow takes the "chat history" and quesiton attributes of the chat input.

<pre><code>
# system:
You are a helpful assistant.

{% for item in chat_history %}
# user:
{{item.inputs.question}}
# assistant:
{{item.outputs.answer}}
{% endfor %}

# user:
{{question}}

</code></pre>

The sample Jinja code, goes through the chat history, appends all prompts and generations from earlier chat dialog, finally adds the chat input (question) and sends this to the LLM.

Now start chatting with the bot. \
After each answer from the chatbot check the output trace.

![Alt text](../../media/lab1324.png)
![Alt text](../../media/lab1325.png)

You will see an increasing number of prompt tokens (user prompt and chat history) and total tokens (prompt tokens and the generation). If you continue the chat you will at some point hit the llm context length and get an error message as sending all chat history with each individual question is not ideal in terms of cost and efficiency.

replace the code in the module with the below, which only uses the most recent 5 interactions...

<pre><code>
# system:
You are a helpful assistant.

{% set recent_chats = chat_history[-5:] if chat_history|length > 5 else chat_history %}

{% for item in recent_chats %}
# user:
{{ item.inputs.question }}
# assistant:
{{ item.outputs.answer }}
{% endfor %}

# user:
{{ question }}
</code></pre>

Copy the code and press "validate and parse input".

Then save the flow and click on "chat" on the top right to run the updated flow

## CREATE A FINANCIAL ADVISOR
Copy and paste the below code to create a "Financial Advisor" chatbot...

<pre><code>
# system:
You are a financial advisor trained at an Ivy League institution, specializing in wealth management, investment strategies, and economic analysis. Your role is to provide expert financial advice and help clients navigate complex financial landscapes.

# introduction:
Welcome to your personal financial advisory service. I am here to assist you with tailored financial strategies and insights. Whether you're interested in portfolio management, investment opportunities, or understanding market trends, I can provide the guidance you need. How can I assist you today?

{% set recent_chats = chat_history[-5:] if chat_history|length > 5 else chat_history %}

{% for item in recent_chats %}
# user:
Client inquired: "{{ item.inputs.question }}"
# assistant:
Advisor responded: "{{ item.outputs.answer }}"
{% endfor %}

# user:
{{ question }}

# assistant:
Thank you for reaching out about {{ question|capitalize }}. To provide you with the most accurate and beneficial advice, let's examine the current trends and historical data relevant to your query.

# dynamic financial advice based on user query:
{% set financial_tips = {
    'stock market': "In today's volatile market, it's essential to stay diversified to protect your investments from unexpected downturns. Diversification not only reduces risk but also positions your portfolio to capture growth across different sectors.",
    'real estate': "Real estate investment can be a lucrative avenue, especially in growing markets. Consider factors such as location, market trends, and economic forecasts when planning your investment to maximize potential returns.",
    'bonds': "Given the current low-interest-rate environment, bonds offer a stable investment but with lower yields. For better returns, you might explore high-grade corporate bonds or diversified bond funds.",
    'cryptocurrency': "Cryptocurrencies offer high growth potential but come with high volatility. If you decide to invest, ensure it's a small portion of your portfolio and consider your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance."
} %}

Considering your interest in {{ question|lower }}, here is a tailored insight: {{ financial_tips[question|lower] | default('This is a complex area with many variables to consider. Could you specify further what aspects you are particularly interested in?') }}

# further engagement:
Feel free to ask more about {{ question }} or any other investment queries you have. My goal is to ensure you feel confident and informed about your financial decisions.
