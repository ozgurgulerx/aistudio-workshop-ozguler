# 1.3.1 Add non-OpenAI models as MaaS 
We can deploy models from META, Cohere, Mistral and any other model from HF Model Hub via AI Studio Model Catalog and use these models as "LLM"'s in PromptFlow.

(An Azure subscription with a valid payment method is required. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work.)

Note - PAYG a.k.a MaaS model deployments are only available on Azure AI Studio and not on Azure ML.
Refer to [How to deploy Meta Llama models with Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-llama?tabs=llama-three) MS Learn documentation.
