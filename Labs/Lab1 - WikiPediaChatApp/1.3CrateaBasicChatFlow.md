# Create a Basic Chat Flow 
In this section we will build a chatflow to demonstrate capabilities of PromptFlow on AI Studio...

Create a "Chat Flow' by cloning the standard Chat template. \
(Follow Section 1.2 for a step-by-step guidance.) 

Make sure there is a VM running under Project Settings. \
(If there isn't create a new VM.)
Then Choose the created VM with the default runtime under advanced settings, update LLM block details and try and confirm the flow is running.

## 1.3.1 Add non-OpenAI models as MaaS 
We can deploy models from META, Cohere, Mistral and other models from HF Model Hub via AI Studio Model Catalog and use these models as "LLM"'s in PromptFlow.

(An Azure subscription with a valid payment method is required. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work.)

Note - PAYG a.k.a MaaS model deployments are only available on Azure AI Studio and not on Azure ML.
Refer to [How to deploy Meta Llama models with Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-llama?tabs=llama-three) MS Learn documentation.
