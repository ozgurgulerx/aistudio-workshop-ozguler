# Prompti 

Prompti is a versatile prompt parsing and formatting tool.
You can use Prompti prompts for evaluation following an [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02839) pattern too. LLM-as-a-Judge we simply use an LLM to "judge" the groundedness, coherence, relevance... etc. of another LLM's generation which surprisingly gives near human evaluation results.
