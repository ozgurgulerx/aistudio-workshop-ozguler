# Prompty

[**Prompty**](https://microsoft.github.io) is a standard format that unifies the prompt and how it is executed as a single, language-independent asset, turning the asset into code. This enables developers to interact with the prompt asset with code.
In that sense Prompti is a versatile prompt parsing and formatting tool. It lets you treat your prompts as a "function".


You can use Prompti prompts for evaluation following an [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02839) pattern too. LLM-as-a-Judge we simply use an LLM to "judge" the groundedness, coherence, relevance... etc. of another LLM's generation which surprisingly gives near human evaluation results.
