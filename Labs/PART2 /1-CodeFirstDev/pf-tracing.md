# PROMPTFLOW TRACING

The tracing feature in PromptFlow is an experimental tool designed to help developers understand and debug their applications by recording specific events and states during execution. This feature follows the OpenTelemetry specification, a popular standard for observability in software systems.

Key Concepts

1.	Tracing:
Tracing involves capturing data about the execution of your application, such as function calls, variable values, and system events. This data can be used to debug and analyze the application’s behavior, particularly in complex scenarios.

2.	OpenTelemetry:
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides APIs and tools to collect and export telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. PromptFlow leverages this specification to provide consistent and comprehensive tracing capabilities.

Traces records specific events or the state of an application during execution. It can include data about function calls, variable values, system events and more. Traces help break down an application’s components into discrete inputs and outputs, which is crucial for debugging and understanding an application. You can learn more from [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) on traces.

Prompt flow provides the trace feature to enable user to trace LLM call or function, and LLM frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen, following [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/).


### Advantages

	•	Detailed Debugging: Captures comprehensive details about function calls and system events, helping identify issues in complex applications.
	•	Standardized: Follows the OpenTelemetry specification, ensuring compatibility and leveraging community tools and knowledge.
	•	Enhanced Observability: Provides insights into the performance and behavior of LLM calls and functions, aiding in optimization and troubleshooting.

### Use Cases

	•	Monitoring LLM Calls: Trace and analyze the performance and behavior of API calls to large language models.
	•	Debugging Complex Code: Apply tracing to critical paths in your code to understand and resolve issues more effectively.
	•	Integrating with Frameworks: Extend tracing capabilities to popular frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen, enhancing their observability.

By incorporating tracing into your PromptFlow applications, you can significantly improve your ability to debug, monitor, and optimize your code. This experimental feature, grounded in OpenTelemetry, offers a powerful toolset for developers working with LLMs and complex workflows.
