Then send a query to the endpoint with a curl statement as below...
(Modify the bearer XXXXX with your endpoint password and the endpoint URL XXX as your endpoint URL. )
```
curl -X POST "XXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXX" \
     -d '{"query":"how does the world economy look like?",
          "question": "how does the world economy look like?",
          "chat_history": "[]"
     }'
```

We confirmed the endpoint works. The endpoint can easily be wrapped within a UI/frontend which can be deployed as an app running on Azure AppService that may provide insights as to the current state of the economy.
